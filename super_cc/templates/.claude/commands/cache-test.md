# Cache System Test Suite

Comprehensive testing and validation of the advanced Git-based caching system with incremental analysis capabilities.

## Usage Options

- `/cache-test --run-tests` - Run comprehensive cache system tests
- `/cache-test --benchmark` - Performance benchmarking of cache vs non-cache
- `/cache-test --validate-rules` - Validate invalidation rules accuracy
- `/cache-test --stress-test` - Stress test with high-frequency cache operations

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Cache Functionality Tests

**Test: Cache Storage and Retrieval**
```bash
# Create test agent output
echo '{"analysis": "test", "tokens": 150}' > .claude/cache/agent-outputs/test-agent-abc123f-feature.json

# Update cache manifest
# Test cache retrieval for same commit/scope
# Verify cache hit logic
```

**Expected Results:**
- Cache files created with correct naming convention
- Manifest updated with metadata
- Cache retrieval works for matching commit/scope
- Cache miss for different commit/scope

### 2. Git-Based Invalidation Tests

**Test: Commit-Based Cache Invalidation**
```bash
# Setup: Create cache entries for commit abc123f
# Action: Make file changes and commit as def456g  
# Test: Verify appropriate caches invalidated based on changed files
```

**Scenarios:**
```
📝 Test Scenario 1: Source Code Changes
   Changed Files: src/auth/models.py
   Expected Invalidations:
   ✅ architect cache (models affect architecture)
   ✅ tester cache (models need testing)
   ✅ reviewer cache (source changes need review)  
   ❌ planner cache (implementation details don't affect plans)
   ❌ context-synth cache (external interface unchanged)

📝 Test Scenario 2: Test-Only Changes  
   Changed Files: tests/auth/test_models.py
   Expected Invalidations:
   ✅ tester cache (test changes always invalidate)
   ❌ architect cache (tests don't affect architecture)
   ❌ planner cache (tests don't change requirements)
   ❌ reviewer cache (test changes don't need code review)

📝 Test Scenario 3: Documentation Changes
   Changed Files: docs/api.md
   Expected Invalidations:
   ✅ documenter cache (documentation scope)
   ❌ architect cache (docs don't change structure)
   ❌ tester cache (docs don't affect test requirements)
   🤔 planner cache (depends on if requirements changed)
```

### 3. Incremental Analysis Tests

**Test: Delta Analysis Accuracy**
```bash
# Create baseline cache for feature
# Make incremental change (add field to model)
# Test incremental analysis vs full analysis
# Verify results are equivalent but faster
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- Incremental analysis produces same conclusions as full analysis
- Significant token savings (>50% reduction)
- Significant time savings (>60% reduction)
- Cache efficiency improved with incremental updates

### 4. Scoped Invalidation Tests

**Test: Feature-Based Cache Scoping**
```
🎯 Setup: Multiple features with separate cache scopes
   Feature A: authentication (src/auth/, tests/auth/)
   Feature B: api (src/api/, tests/api/)
   
🧪 Test: Change authentication files
   Expected: Only auth-scoped caches invalidated
   Expected: API-scoped caches preserved
   Expected: Shared architectural cache handled correctly
```

### 5. Performance Benchmarks

**Benchmark: Cache vs Non-Cache Performance**
```
⚡ Performance Test Suite:

Test 1: Cold Start (No Cache)
   - Execute full workflow with all agents
   - Measure: Total tokens, total time, agent utilization
   - Baseline: 100% token usage, 100% time

Test 2: Warm Cache (High Hit Rate)  
   - Execute same workflow with established cache
   - Measure: Token savings, time savings, cache hit rate
   - Target: >70% token savings, >80% time savings

Test 3: Mixed Cache (Partial Hit Rate)
   - Execute workflow with some cache hits, some misses
   - Measure: Proportional savings based on hit rate
   - Validate: Linear relationship between hit rate and savings

Test 4: Cache Overhead
   - Measure: Cache lookup time, storage overhead
   - Validate: Overhead < 5% of execution time
   - Validate: Storage growth manageable
```

### 6. Stress Testing

**Stress Test: High-Frequency Operations**
```bash
# Rapid cache operations
for i in {1..100}; do
    # Create cache entry
    # Invalidate cache  
    # Recreate cache
    # Measure performance degradation
done

# Concurrent access simulation
# Large cache size handling
# Cache cleanup under pressure
```

### 7. Rule Validation Tests

**Test: Invalidation Rule Accuracy**
```yaml
# Test each invalidation rule
test_cases:
  src/auth/models.py:
    should_invalidate: [architect, tester, reviewer]
    should_preserve: [planner, context-synth]
    
  tests/unit/test_auth.py:
    should_invalidate: [tester]
    should_preserve: [architect, planner, reviewer, context-synth]
    
  docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:
    should_invalidate: [architect, planner, documenter]  
    should_preserve: [tester, reviewer]
```

## Test Execution Framework

### Automated Test Suite
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cache-test-runner.sh

echo "🧪 Running Cache System Tests..."

# Test 1: Basic functionality
test_cache_storage_retrieval() {
    echo "📝 Testing cache storage and retrieval..."
    # Implementation
}

# Test 2: Git integration
test_git_invalidation() {
    echo "🔄 Testing Git-based invalidation..."
    # Implementation  
}

# Test 3: Performance
test_performance_benchmarks() {
    echo "⚡ Running performance benchmarks..."
    # Implementation
}

# Run all tests
run_all_tests() {
    test_cache_storage_retrieval
    test_git_invalidation  
    test_performance_benchmarks
    generate_test_report
}
