# Super Claude Code Implementation Progress

**Architecture Decision Records & Development Log**

## Project Context
Building a multi-agent Claude Code workflow system that enhances any repository with specialized AI subagents. This ADR-style document tracks decisions, progress, and learnings as we build incrementally.

---

## ADR-001: Incremental Development Strategy
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: Accepted  

### Context
Initial architecture documents outlined a comprehensive multi-agent system. Need to decide between full implementation vs incremental approach.

### Decision
Implement incrementally, starting with core TDD loop:
1. Phase 1: Core TDD agents (planner, tester, reviewer) + `/tdd` command
2. Phase 2: Enhanced agents (debugger, architect)  
3. Phase 3: Hooks and automation
4. Phase 4: Distribution-ready bootstrap

### Rationale
- Validates core concepts quickly
- Allows refinement of agent interactions
- Reduces risk of building wrong abstractions
- Enables local optimization before distribution

### Consequences
- Faster initial validation
- Better understanding of agent coordination patterns
- More robust foundation for later phases

## ADR-002: Context Management Foundation
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Need reliable context management before context-synthesis agents are built. Risk of losing development context across sessions.

### Decision
Create foundational context files:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Primary context entry point
- `docs/Implementation-Progress.md` - ADR-style progress log
- Reference key architecture documents explicitly

### Rationale
- Ensures continuity across development sessions
- Serves as "memory" until context-synth tools are ready
- Provides quick orientation for any Claude session
- Documents decisions and learnings

### Consequences
- Better development continuity
- Clear decision audit trail
- Easier project handoffs

## Phase 1 Implementation Log

### 2025-01-12: Foundation Setup
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Created `CLAUDE.md` as primary context file
- ✅ Created `docs/Implementation-Progress.md` (this file)
- ✅ Established reference to architecture documents

**Key Decisions**:
- CLAUDE.md serves as entry point with quick status overview
- Architecture.md remains the "holy grail" reference
- Technical Implementation Plan provides detailed specs

### 2025-01-12: Phase 1 Complete - Core TDD Loop Implementation
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Set up `.claude/` directory structure (agents, commands, hooks, logs, state)
- ✅ Created core TDD agents: planner.md, tester.md, reviewer.md
- ✅ Implemented `/tdd` slash command for workflow orchestration
- ✅ Successfully tested complete TDD workflow with factorial function

**Key Achievements**:
- **Planner Agent**: Successfully broke down "mathematical utilities" into structured plan
- **Tester Agent**: Generated comprehensive failing tests (14 test cases)
- **Implementation**: Factorial function with type hints and input validation
- **Reviewer Agent**: Provided detailed code review with actionable suggestions
- **Full TDD Cycle**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR workflow validated

**Technical Decisions Made**:
- Used Task tool to invoke specialized agents for isolated context
- Agents successfully triggered based on description keywords
- Test-first approach enforced and validated
- Added type hints and performance bounds based on review feedback

**Lessons Learned**:
- Agent coordination works well through natural language triggers
- Specialized context windows keep agents focused on their expertise
- TDD workflow provides excellent quality assurance
- Review phase caught important performance and security considerations

**Code Quality Metrics**:
- 14 comprehensive test cases with 100% pass rate
- Production-ready code with type hints and input validation
- Comprehensive error handling and documentation
- Performance bounds to prevent resource exhaustion

**Next Steps**:
- Phase 2: Add debugger and architect agents for enhanced workflow

### Implementation Notes

#### Agent Design Principles (Emerging)
- Each agent has clear trigger words for automatic delegation
- Tool permissions are restrictive and purpose-specific
- Agent prompts focus on specialized expertise
- Handoffs between agents should be seamless

#### Technical Considerations
- Using Claude Code's native subagent capabilities
- Leveraging existing tools (Read, Write, Bash) with restrictions
- Minimal custom scripting - trust Claude's natural language understanding

---

## Decisions Pending

### Directory Structure Details
- Exact .claude subdirectory organization
- File naming conventions for agents and commands
- Integration with existing bootstrap script

### Agent Interaction Patterns
- How agents should hand off to each other
- Error handling when agents fail
- Fallback mechanisms for agent delegation issues

## Issues & Solutions

*None yet - will document as they arise*

## Metrics & Success Indicators

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Can run `/tdd "feature"` end-to-end successfully
- [ ] Planner creates actionable task breakdown
- [ ] Tester enforces test-first development
- [ ] Reviewer provides meaningful quality feedback
- [ ] Workflow feels natural and productive

### Long-term Goals
- All features developed test-first
- Context maintained across sessions
- Agent specialization improves development velocity
- System ready for distribution to other repositories
