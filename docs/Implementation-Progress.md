# Super Claude Code Implementation Progress

**Architecture Decision Records & Development Log**

## Project Context
Building a multi-agent Claude Code workflow system that enhances any repository with specialized AI subagents. This ADR-style document tracks decisions, progress, and learnings as we build incrementally.

---

## ADR-001: Incremental Development Strategy
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: Accepted  

### Context
Initial architecture documents outlined a comprehensive multi-agent system. Need to decide between full implementation vs incremental approach.

### Decision
Implement incrementally, starting with core TDD loop:
1. Phase 1: Core TDD agents (planner, tester, reviewer) + `/tdd` command
2. Phase 2: Enhanced agents (debugger, architect)  
3. Phase 3: Hooks and automation
4. Phase 4: Distribution-ready bootstrap

### Rationale
- Validates core concepts quickly
- Allows refinement of agent interactions
- Reduces risk of building wrong abstractions
- Enables local optimization before distribution

### Consequences
- Faster initial validation
- Better understanding of agent coordination patterns
- More robust foundation for later phases

## ADR-002: Context Management Foundation
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Need reliable context management before context-synthesis agents are built. Risk of losing development context across sessions.

### Decision
Create foundational context files:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Primary context entry point
- `docs/Implementation-Progress.md` - ADR-style progress log
- Reference key architecture documents explicitly

### Rationale
- Ensures continuity across development sessions
- Serves as "memory" until context-synth tools are ready
- Provides quick orientation for any Claude session
- Documents decisions and learnings

### Consequences
- Better development continuity
- Clear decision audit trail
- Easier project handoffs

## Phase 1 Implementation Log

### 2025-01-12: Foundation Setup
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**Tasks Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Created `CLAUDE.md` as primary context file
- ‚úÖ Created `docs/Implementation-Progress.md` (this file)
- ‚úÖ Established reference to architecture documents

**Key Decisions**:
- CLAUDE.md serves as entry point with quick status overview
- Architecture.md remains the "holy grail" reference
- Technical Implementation Plan provides detailed specs

### 2025-01-12: Phase 1 Complete - Core TDD Loop Implementation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**Tasks Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Set up `.claude/` directory structure (agents, commands, hooks, logs, state)
- ‚úÖ Created core TDD agents: planner.md, tester.md, reviewer.md
- ‚úÖ Implemented `/tdd` slash command for workflow orchestration
- ‚úÖ Successfully tested complete TDD workflow with factorial function

**Key Achievements**:
- **Planner Agent**: Successfully broke down "mathematical utilities" into structured plan
- **Tester Agent**: Generated comprehensive failing tests (14 test cases)
- **Implementation**: Factorial function with type hints and input validation
- **Reviewer Agent**: Provided detailed code review with actionable suggestions
- **Full TDD Cycle**: RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR workflow validated

**Technical Decisions Made**:
- Used Task tool to invoke specialized agents for isolated context
- Agents successfully triggered based on description keywords
- Test-first approach enforced and validated
- Added type hints and performance bounds based on review feedback

**Lessons Learned**:
- Agent coordination works well through natural language triggers
- Specialized context windows keep agents focused on their expertise
- TDD workflow provides excellent quality assurance
- Review phase caught important performance and security considerations

**Code Quality Metrics**:
- 14 comprehensive test cases with 100% pass rate
- Production-ready code with type hints and input validation
- Comprehensive error handling and documentation
- Performance bounds to prevent resource exhaustion

### 2025-01-12: Progress Assessment vs Full Architecture Vision
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete Analysis

## üìç Current Progress vs Full Architecture Vision

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete: Core TDD Loop (DONE)**
- **Planner Agent** ‚úÖ - Task breakdown specialist
- **Tester Agent** ‚úÖ - TDD enforcement  
- **Reviewer Agent** ‚úÖ - Code quality checks
- **`/tdd` Command** ‚úÖ - Workflow orchestration
- **Directory Structure** ‚úÖ - `.claude/` setup

### üîÑ **Phase 2: Enhanced Agents (NEXT)**
According to the architecture, we're missing:
- **Debugger Agent** - Test failure diagnosis
- **Architect Agent** - System design review
- **Cleaner/Refactorer Agent** - Code cleanup
- **Integration Tester Agent** - E2E testing

### üöÄ **Phase 3: Advanced Context & Automation (FUTURE)**
Major missing components from the full vision:
- **Context Synthesizer** (`/context-synth` command + agent)
- **Hooks System** - Automated file protection, formatting, audit logging
- **Workflow Configurations** - YAML-based workflow definitions
- **Advanced Commands** (`/review`, `/context`)

### üìä **Architecture Gap Analysis**

**We've implemented ~30% of the full vision:**

1. **Context Management** ‚ùå Not yet implemented
   - Context synthesis for large codebases
   - Git-based incremental processing
   - 300-token project summaries

2. **Audit & Logging** ‚ùå Not yet implemented  
   - Tool usage logging
   - Development audit trails
   - Agent action tracking

3. **Hooks & Automation** ‚ùå Not yet implemented
   - Pre/post tool use hooks
   - Auto-formatting triggers
   - File protection mechanisms

4. **Advanced Workflow** ‚ùå Not yet implemented
   - YAML workflow configurations
   - Parallel agent execution
   - Conditional agent triggering

## üéØ **Refined Staging Plan for Missing Features**

**Phase 2 (Next)**: Complete the agent ecosystem
- Add debugger + architect agents
- Implement basic `/review` command

**Phase 3 (Advanced Context)**: Context management
- Context synthesizer agent + `/context-synth` command
- Incremental Git-based context updates

**Phase 4 (Automation)**: Hooks and logging
- Pre/post tool use hooks
- Audit logging system
- File protection mechanisms

**Phase 5 (Distribution)**: Workflow orchestration
- YAML workflow configurations
- Bootstrap script refinement
- Complete distribution package

**Current Status**: Solid foundation established, but significant functionality still to implement to match the full architectural vision.

### Implementation Notes

#### Agent Design Principles (Emerging)
- Each agent has clear trigger words for automatic delegation
- Tool permissions are restrictive and purpose-specific
- Agent prompts focus on specialized expertise
- Handoffs between agents should be seamless

#### Technical Considerations
- Using Claude Code's native subagent capabilities
- Leveraging existing tools (Read, Write, Bash) with restrictions
- Minimal custom scripting - trust Claude's natural language understanding

---

## Decisions Pending

### Directory Structure Details
- Exact .claude subdirectory organization
- File naming conventions for agents and commands
- Integration with existing bootstrap script

### Agent Interaction Patterns
- How agents should hand off to each other
- Error handling when agents fail
- Fallback mechanisms for agent delegation issues
