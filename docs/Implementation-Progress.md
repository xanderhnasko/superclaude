# Super Claude Code Implementation Progress

**Architecture Decision Records & Development Log**

## Project Context
Building a multi-agent Claude Code workflow system that enhances any repository with specialized AI subagents. This ADR-style document tracks decisions, progress, and learnings as we build incrementally.

---

## ADR-001: Incremental Development Strategy
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: Accepted  

### Context
Initial architecture documents outlined a comprehensive multi-agent system. Need to decide between full implementation vs incremental approach.

### Decision
Implement incrementally, starting with core TDD loop:
1. Phase 1: Core TDD agents (planner, tester, reviewer) + `/tdd` command
2. Phase 2: Enhanced agents (debugger, architect)  
3. Phase 3: Hooks and automation
4. Phase 4: Distribution-ready bootstrap

### Rationale
- Validates core concepts quickly
- Allows refinement of agent interactions
- Reduces risk of building wrong abstractions
- Enables local optimization before distribution

### Consequences
- Faster initial validation
- Better understanding of agent coordination patterns
- More robust foundation for later phases

## ADR-002: Context Management Foundation
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Need reliable context management before context-synthesis agents are built. Risk of losing development context across sessions.

### Decision
Create foundational context files:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Primary context entry point
- `docs/Implementation-Progress.md` - ADR-style progress log
- Reference key architecture documents explicitly

### Rationale
- Ensures continuity across development sessions
- Serves as "memory" until context-synth tools are ready
- Provides quick orientation for any Claude session
- Documents decisions and learnings

### Consequences
- Better development continuity
- Clear decision audit trail
- Easier project handoffs

### Implementation Notes

#### Agent Design Principles (Emerging)
- Each agent has clear trigger words for automatic delegation
- Tool permissions are restrictive and purpose-specific
- Agent prompts focus on specialized expertise
- Handoffs between agents should be seamless

#### Technical Considerations
- Using Claude Code's native subagent capabilities
- Leveraging existing tools (Read, Write, Bash) with restrictions
- Minimal custom scripting - trust Claude's natural language understanding

## Decisions Pending

### Directory Structure Details
- Exact .claude subdirectory organization
- File naming conventions for agents and commands
- Integration with existing bootstrap script

### Agent Interaction Patterns
- How agents should hand off to each other
- Error handling when agents fail
- Fallback mechanisms for agent delegation issues
